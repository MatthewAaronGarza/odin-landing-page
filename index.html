                        <p>Tigers are not only the largest members of the cat family, but they are also one of the most iconic and revered animals in the world. In fact, the tiger is considered a national symbol of many countries, including India, Bangladesh, Malaysia, and South Korea.

                        <p>The incredible strength and agility of tigers are matched only by their exceptional hunting skills. These magnificent beasts are capable of bringing down prey that is several times their size, such as deer, wild boar, and even adult water buffalo.

                        <p>Despite their reputation as fierce predators, tigers are also known for their playful and affectionate nature. In fact, tigers are among the few big cats that enjoy swimming, and they have been known to playfully chase each other in the water.

                        <p>Unfortunately, tigers are also one of the most endangered animals in the world. In the past century, the population of wild tigers has declined by over 95%, with only around 3,900 tigers remaining in the wild today. Habitat loss, poaching, and illegal trade are the main threats to their survival, and urgent conservation efforts are needed to protect these magnificent animals for future generations.
